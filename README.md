1) The main objective of this project is to analyze steel production data to build models using machine learning techniques that helps to predict a factor describes steel quality.The dataset contains both the training and testing dataset. By performing systematic data preprocessing, model building and training, the study was able to succesfully build predictive models that describes the quality of steel.<br>
2) Dataset Description:<br> i) Data set contains both training and testing data.<br>
                   ii) Both the dataset consists of 22 columns including the output column(target column).<br>
                   iii) There are 7642 entries in training dataset and 3337 entries in test dataset.<br>
3) Models Implemented: The following four models were implemented<br>
i) Random forest Regressor<br>
ii) Support Vector Machine (SVM)<br>
iii) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)<br>
iv) Gaussian Process Regressor<br>
4) Evaluation Metrics : <br>
i) Root mean squared error (RMSE)<br>
ii) Mean absolute error (MAE)<br>
iii) R2 score<br>
5) Results<br>
The model with the highest r2 score and least error values is considered as the good model.<br>
Of the four models, the Random model regressor models shows the best performance with highest r2 score and least error values.<br>
The next performed model is Supoort vector machine (SVM), whereas the other two models underperformed.
